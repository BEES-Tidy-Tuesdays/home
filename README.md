## What is BEES tidy tuesdays?
A weekly social data project using the R ecosystem for PhD students (and other interesting people), run within the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences (BEES) at the University of New South Wales; adopted from the ![Tidy-Tuesdays project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

### What does tidy tuesdays cover?
Tidy-tuesdays focuses to create **a safe and supportive learning environment** for PhD students in BEES to
  - enhance their data analysis and visualisation skills.
  - get feedbacks from others
  - explore other's work
  - get to know with students (and other interesting people) in our school.

## How we meet and learn?

For each meeting, we share a raw dataset, a figure or an article asscociated to that dataset, and invite you to explore the data. The dataset may not always be tidy; thus we ask you to apply various data wrangling techniques within the R ecosystem to make the data tidy!

Bring your laptop and make sure the R software and the development environment RStudio are installed on your computer.


### What does tidy tuesdays not cover?

While we encourage you to come up with some questions that potentially can be explored with the data, drawing causations and conclusions from the data are not part of our objective. 

## Who can join tidy-tuesdays?

PhD students (and other interesting people) within the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences (BEES) are encouraged to join. No prior programming knowledge required, we invite everyone to join!
    

## When and where?
We meet Tuesdays weekly at 3 pm.
