## What are BEES Tidy Tuesdays?
A weekly social data project using the R ecosystem for PhD students (and anyone else that wants to come), run within the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences (BEES) at UNSW Sydney; adopted from the [Tidy-Tuesdays project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

## When and where are BEES Tidy Tuesdays?
Tuesdays! We meet each week from 3pm-4pm in the Rountree room (Level 3, Biolink).

## What do Tidy Tuesdays cover?
Tidy Tuesdays aims to create **a safe and supportive learning environment** for PhD students in BEES to:
  - enhance their data analysis and visualisation skills
  - learn and recieve feedback from others
  - discover other's work
  - get to know other PhD students in the school
  
## What do Tidy Tuesdays not cover?

While we can answer easy statistics questions, the best place to get advice on stats is from [Stats Central](https://www.analytical.unsw.edu.au/facilities/stats-central).

Same goes for IT problems. We can try to help, but [UNSW IT](https://www.myit.unsw.edu.au/) is where you should direct most of the more technical questions.

For now we are focussing on only the R ecosystem, so we will not be working in other programming languages.

## How we meet and learn?

For each meeting, we get a interesting raw dataset, and invite you to explore the data. The dataset often may be 'messy', so we will get you to apply various data wrangling techniques within the R ecosystem to make the data 'tidy'!

Bring your laptop and make sure the R software and the development environment RStudio are installed on your computer.

## Who can join tidy-tuesdays?

All PhD students within the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences (BEES) are encouraged to join, however all are welcome. No prior programming knowledge required, we invite everyone to join!
